# Candidates Info Scraping
This code was created to get information about the candidates of the Peruvian elections in 2021, and to use this information in Elegimos.pe webpage. 

I used Selenium Python package to scrap information and store it in json files. The selenium bot took the information of more than 3000 Peruvian candidates in JNE webpage.
